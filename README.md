# lip_syncing

Lip syncing, short for "lip synchronization," is the practice of moving one's lips in synchronization with pre-recorded audio or music. It is commonly used in various forms of entertainment, such as music videos, live performances, television shows, and movies. Lip syncing is employed when a performer or actor pretends to sing or speak while miming the words, but the actual sound is coming from a previously recorded source, such as a vocal track or dialogue recording.
